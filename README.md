## The Open Name Service Framework (ONSF)

The ONSF can deploy chain-agnostic, on-chain name service contracts for any novel web3 TLD, like for example `.uniswap`, or `.protocol`. The framework comprises a minting site and a marketplace, resolving HTTP APIs, and integration toolkits. 

ONSF forks rely on EXM and everPay, two chain-agnostic Arweave-based L2s. Forks can work in conjunction with the everPay team to support any previously unsupported EVM-chain token in their L2 payments protocol (token listing/integration). In addition, we will provide a `.yourdomain` domain explorer and technical support for `.yourdomain` community.

### Technical Specifications:
ONSF's business model is to provide a custom NS free of cost in exchange for a percentage of the project's custom domain minting proceeds. The gained ONSF's protocol fees will be used to cover the burn rate and expenses to achieve the `Deliverables` below. 

### Deliverables:
#### - Technical:
- Custom ONSF NS contract for your TLD
- A minting site similar to [ans.gg](https://ans.gg)
- A marketplace, similar to https://www.ans.gg/marketplace
- Resolving APIs and integration toolkits
- Support for EverFinance to integrate your token as a payment method
- A domain explorer, akin to https://www.ans.gg/explorer
- Integrating `.yourdomain` NS with [HandShake protocol](https://handshake.org/) (HNS).
- Customized shortlinks gateway for the `.yourdomain` owners. Example: [ArMoji](https://github.com/decentldotland/ArMoji) -- [ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚.arweave.bio](http://ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚.arweave.bio)

### Forks Example: ANS (`.ar` is an ONSF variant for the Arweave network)

- age: ~2 months old
- minting revenues: ~4400 $AR ($7.7 / $AR at the time of writing)
- total unique users: 781
- minting domains: 138
